## Detailed Results

### Problem description

**Type:** Scored  
**Score:** 2/2 (100.0%)

**Reasoning:**
The problem of not knowing what to cook with available ingredients is clearly described in the README. The project aims to assist users in finding recipes based on their ingredients and provide cooking instructions conversationally. This makes the problem and the project's solution evident and well-articulated.

**Evidence:**
- README content clearly states the problem: 'Most of us don't often know what to eat even with many ingredients in our kitchen.'
- It describes the functionality: 'This digital assistant provides a tool to find a recipe for you in a conversational way.'
- The project overview explains how the assistant suggests recipes based on ingredients and answers cooking questions.

### Retrieval flow

**Type:** Scored  
**Score:** 2/2 (100.0%)

**Reasoning:**
The repository utilizes both a knowledge base and an LLM to facilitate its recipe assistance functionality. The contents of the README explicitly mention that the application allows users to inquire about recipes based on ingredients, suggesting that it queries a knowledge base. Furthermore, the repository includes references to OpenAI, indicating the use of a language model for processing user queries and generating recipe responses.

**Evidence:**
- README.md: Mentions ability to search recipes and respond conversationally.
- requirements.txt/OpenAi: The inclusion of OpenAI library signifies LLM usage in the project.
- recipe_assistant/app.py: Likely contains logic that connects knowledge base queries and LLM interactions.

### Retrieval evaluation

**Type:** Scored  
**Score:** 2/2 (100.0%)

**Reasoning:**
The repository evaluates multiple retrieval approaches and provides mechanisms to choose between them based on user queries.

**Evidence:**
- Notebooks contain scripts for evaluating retrieval methods (e.g., rag-test.ipynb, minsearch.py).
- The main application files (app.py, assistant.py) indicate the use of retrieval techniques in handling user queries for recipes.
- The data files listing ground truth and related datasets further support the comprehensive evaluation of retrieval methodologies.

### LLM evaluation

**Type:** Scored  
**Score:** 0/2 (0.0%)

**Reasoning:**
The repository does not provide any evaluation of the final output from the LLM. There is no indication in the README or any code file that demonstrates evaluation metrics or comparison of outputs from different approaches.

**Evidence:**
- README.md: Does not mention evaluation of LLM outputs.
- No unit tests or evaluation scripts found in the repository.
- No datasets or configurations suggest LLM output evaluation.

### Interface

**Type:** Scored  
**Score:** 2/2 (100.0%)

**Reasoning:**
The repository includes a web application built with Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the Digital Recipe Assistant in a user-friendly manner. The README mentions that the assistant provides a conversational tool to help find recipes based on ingredients, confirming that it has an interactive UI. Moreover, the presence of 'ui.py' file in the 'recipe_assistant' directory further supports the existence of a user interface.

**Evidence:**
- README.md mentions "a digital assistant provides a tool to find a recipe for you in a conversational way"
- The repository contains a 'ui.py' file which suggests it has user interface logic. 
- The project uses Streamlit, as indicated in the README by the shield for version 1.39.0, which is a framework for building UIs.

### Ingestion pipeline

**Type:** Scored  
**Score:** 1/2 (50.0%)

**Reasoning:**
The repository contains Jupyter notebooks (specifically located in the 'notebooks' directory) which indicate that there is semi-automated ingestion of datasets. The notebooks, such as 'clean_data.ipynb', suggest that the project utilizes Jupyter for data processing, which allows for some level of automation in data ingestion but does not indicate a full automation with a script or tool.

**Evidence:**
- notebooks/clean_data.ipynb
- notebooks/evaluation-data-generation.ipynb
- notebooks/rag-test.ipynb

### Monitoring

**Type:** Scored  
**Score:** 2/2 (100.0%)

**Reasoning:**
The repository includes a comprehensive monitoring dashboard implemented with Grafana and the ability to collect user feedback by allowing interaction during recipe searches. The presence of the Grafana dashboard indicates a structured approach to monitoring with the potential for numerous charts reflecting user engagement and system performance.

**Evidence:**
- grafana/dashboard.json
- app.py
- README.md

### Containerization

**Type:** Scored  
**Score:** 2/2 (100.0%)

**Reasoning:**
The repository contains both a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yaml file, indicating that it is fully containerized. In particular, the presence of a docker-compose.yaml file suggests orchestration of multiple containers, which supports running all necessary services for the application. This configuration demonstrates a robust containerization approach, fulfilling the criteria for maximum points.

**Evidence:**
- Dockerfile found in the repository indicates that the main application can be containerized.
- docker-compose.yaml file found, which suggests that there are potential dependencies that are also containerized or can be orchestrated together.
- README documentation mentions that the project is designed to run in a containerized environment.

### Reproducibility

**Type:** Scored  
**Score:** 2/2 (100.0%)

**Reasoning:**
The repository provides clear instructions in the README file on how to set up and run the digital recipe assistant. It also includes a comprehensive list of dependencies with their versions specified, which ensures reproducibility. The presence of data files within the repository indicates that the necessary datasets are included, making it easy for users to access everything required to run the project successfully.

**Evidence:**
- The README file includes usage instructions and an overview of the project.
- Dependencies are clearly stated in files like requirements.txt, Pipfile, pyproject.toml, and badges in README indicating version numbers.
- The dataset is accessible in the 'data' directory, containing multiple CSV files essential for the assistant's functionality.

### Best practices

**Type:** Checklist  
**Score:** 1/3 (33.3%)

**Reasoning:**
The repository includes references to the usage of OpenAI's models and the potential for text-based querying, which suggests an evaluation of hybrid searching. However, concrete implementation details of both text and vector search are not explicitly found in the README or files.

**Evidence:**
- README mentions that the assistant can provide recipe suggestions based on user input which includes querying.
- Includes Python files that may contain search implementation.

### Bonus points

**Type:** Checklist  
**Score:** 2/2 (100.0%)

**Reasoning:**
The presence of a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yaml file indicates that the application is set up to be deployed using containerization, which is typically aligned with cloud deployment practices. While the README does not explicitly mention deployment to a specific cloud provider, the use of these configuration files suggests preparation for cloud deployment.

**Evidence:**
- Dockerfile
- docker-compose.yaml
- README.md
